Some tweaks that were neeeded:
	After the full build of PyObjC, needed to add a __init__.py file in PyObjCTools folder
	Needed to add extra "import" statements to rumps.py: AppKit, Foundation
	Needed to rebuild the Pyinstaller Mac 32-bit bootloader after removing the line to run the app in the foreground
