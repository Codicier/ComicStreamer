Introduction
----------------
ComicStreamer is a media server app for sharing a library of comic files
via a simple REST API to client applications.  It allows for searching
for comics based on a rich set of metadata including fields like series
name, title, publisher, story arcs, characters, and creator credits.

A web interface is also available for searching and viewing comics files.

It's best used on libraries that have been tagged internally with tools
like ComicTagger (http://code.google.com/p/comictagger/) or ComicRack
(http://comicrack.cyolito.com/). However, even without tags, it will
try to parse out some information from the filename (usually series,
issue number, and publication year).

ComicStreamer is very early ALPHA stages, and may be be very flakey, eating up 
memory and CPU cycles. In particular, with very large datasets, filters on the
sub-lists (characters, credits ) can be slow, and credit filters in particular
may provide erroneous results.
